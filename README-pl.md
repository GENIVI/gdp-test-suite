# gdp-test-suite
A test suite for the GENIVI Demo platform

GENIVI releases a demonstrator platform for testing and demonstrations. This test suite is a simple "smoke" test to check the GDP. The test suite itself is just a proof of concept at the moment and is barely usable. The goal is to have a fairly complete set of smoke tests and potentially integrate it into the GENIVI continuous integration set up.

If you want to just download the code and try it out (caveat emptor) you can do this;
